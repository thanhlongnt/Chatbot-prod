            <h2 id="strategy-title">Strategy #1: Test Case Minimization</h2>
            <h3>Explanation:</h3>
            <p id="strategy-explanation">Test Case Minimization involves simplifying a test case to include only the essential elements needed to reproduce a specific bug. This process helps in identifying the exact conditions under which a bug manifests, thereby making the debugging process more efficient. In software testing, particularly in debugging, it's crucial to isolate the problem quickly and efficiently. By minimizing the test case, testers remove any superfluous inputs, configurations, or steps that do not contribute to the occurrence of the bug. This not only clarifies the root cause but also saves time and resources during the testing phase.</p>
            <h3>Example:</h3>
            <p id="strategy-example">Imagine you're developing a mobile app for your college to track class schedules and you encounter a bug that causes the app to crash when trying to load the schedule. Initially, your test case might include various user actions like logging in, navigating through different menus, and performing background updates. To minimize the test case, you would strip away all actions except for loading the schedule, ensuring that the crash occurs solely during this action and not due to any other interference.</p>
            <h3>Coding Example:</h3>
            <pre id="strategy-coding-example" style="background-color: #f8f8f8; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 15px; overflow: auto;"></pre>
            <pre><code id="strategy-coding-example" class="language-python"></code></pre>
            <h3>Extra Notes:</h3>
            <p id="strategy-additions">Utilize automated tools like delta debugging, which systematically tests variations of the input data and determines the minimal set that still causes the bug. This technique is particularly useful in complex systems where manually identifying the minimal test case could be impractical.</p>

        <h2>UC San Diego Study Participation Invitation</h2>
        <p>
          Hello there! You are being invited to participate in a research study titled A
          study of chatbots to aid debugging. 
        </p>
        <p>This study is being done by Michael Coblenz & Thanh-Long Nguyen-Trong from UC San Diego CSE
          Department. The purpose of this research study is to test the
          effectiveness of a new debugging tool. If you agree to take part in
          this study, you will be asked to request debugging help from our tool.
          Your participation in this study is completely voluntary and you can
          withdraw at any time. 
        </p>
        <p>
          You are free to skip any question that you
          choose. If you have questions about this project or if you have a
          research-related problem, you may contact the researcher, Michael
          Coblenz, mcoblenz@ucsd.edu. If you have any questions concerning your
          rights as a research subject, you may contact the UC San Diego Office
          of IRB Administration at irb@ucsd.edu or 858-246-4777.
